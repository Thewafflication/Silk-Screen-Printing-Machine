I am a student at Western Technical College, pursuing an Associates of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology degree.  In my final term, I am taking a capstone project course.  In this course, my skills will be demonstrated, and further developed.

## Goal: 

I want to build a device that can silk screen laminate copper boards, with very little user intervention. The invention will be developed in ten phases. The device will be created using only open source tools, and the device will be open source. The design is released under the Tuscan Amateur Packet Radio Open Hardware License Version 1.0 (TAPR OHLv1.0), and the firmware is released under the GNU Public License Version 3 (GPLv3).

## Requirements:

The project should be fully functional, and presentation ready by 4/15/2018.
The project must use the TI Launchpad MSP432P401R.
The project must follow a budget.

## Team Members:

Jordan Waughtal

I am the founder of the project. I contribute to the physical construction and documentation. I also contribute to the software, and it documentation. I make all purchases and maintain the ledger.  I also control the master development branch. (I have final say in all changes made to the project.)  I also spread the word about the project over the internet to develop interest.

## Objectives:

    Objective 0.1:
    The project should be a functional conveyor belt. There will be two belts, driven by the same source, and spaced about 8" apart.  This gap will allow for a self-cleaning function in a future revision.  
    Objective 0.2:
    The project should have a microswitch, with an adjustable trip point that will interrupt the belt.  An emergency stop button should also be added, that will completely shut down the machine, and trip an alarm condition.
    Objective 0.3:
    At this point, the project should be able to raise and lower a detachable screen over the conveyor belt.
    Objective 0.4:
    At this point, the project should be able to lower a squeegee to the screen.
    Objective 0.5:
    At this point, the project should be able to drag the squeegee across the screen.
    Objective 0.6:
    At this point, the project should be able to dispense ink onto the screen.
    Objective 0.7:
    At this point, the project should be able to clean itself.  It should turn off the valved ink, turn on a valve for water and detergent and start the water pump.
    Objective 0.8:
    At this point, the project should be able to communicate with future equipment, used in the silk screen process.
    Objective 0.9:
    At this point, the project should be able to communicate with a server. The purpose of the server is to monitor the status of the machinery and collect data.
    Objective 1.0:
    At this point, the circuitry for the project should be moved to a PCB design, and the machine should be able to produce the PCB.
