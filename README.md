Create a detailed description of your project. Including but not limited to: project objectives, team members and their specific responsibilities, how you will measure your objectives. Ideally your project should be something that can be done in phases. Start with something basic get it working then add the next phase. Include each phase in the report. This is not a document that can be created in 30 min. The better you do on this report the easier the remaining documents will be to create. You are not "locked" into the contents of this report. The project cannot be all hardware or software but can be up to75% of one type. You also must have a minimum of approximately 25% original material. If you use circuits or programs from the web you must give credit to the author or cite the website. See Westerns Academic Dishonesty Statement in syllabus. Due 1/10, 12:40 PM
