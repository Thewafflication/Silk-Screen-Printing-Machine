Create a detailed description of your project. Including but not limited to: project objectives, team members and their specific responsibilities, how you will measure your objectives. Ideally your project should be something that can be done in phases. Start with something basic get it working then add the next phase. Include each phase in the report. This is not a document that can be created in 30 min. The better you do on this report the easier the remaining documents will be to create. You are not "locked" into the contents of this report. The project cannot be all hardware or software but can be up to75% of one type. You also must have a minimum of approximately 25% original material. If you use circuits or programs from the web you must give credit to the author or cite the website. See Westerns Academic Dishonesty Statement in syllabus. Due 1/10, 12:40 PM

//TODO Ian Please spellcheck this document.

We are students at Western Technical College, pursuing Associates of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology degree.  In our final term, we are taking a capstone project course.  In this course our skills will be demonstrateded, and further developed.

Goal: 

We want to build a device that can silk screen laminate copper boards, with very little user intervention. The device will be developed in //TODO phases. The device will be created using only open source tools, and the device will be released under the TAPR OHL version 1.0.

Requirements:

The project should be fully functional, and presentation ready by 4/15/2018.
The project must use the TI Launchpad MSP432P401R.
The project must follow a budget.

Team Members:

Jordan Waughtal
I am the founder of the project. I mainly contribute to the physical construction and documentation. I make all purchases and maintain the ledger.  I also control the master development branch. (I have final say in all changes made to the project.)  I also spread the word about the project over the internet to develop intrest.

Objectives:

    Objective 0.1:
    The project should be a functional conveyor belt. There will be two belts, driven by the same source, and spaced about 8" apart.  This gap will allow for a self cleaning function in a future revision.  
    Objective 0.2:
    The project should have a microswitch, with an adjustable trip point that will interupt the belt.  An emergancy stop button should also be added, that will completely shut down the machine, and trip an alarm condidtion.
    Objective 0.3:
    At this point the project should be able to raise and lower a detachable screen over the the conveyor belt.
    Objective 0.4:
    At this point the project should be able to lower a squegee to the screen.
    Objective 0.5:
    At this point the project should be able to drag the squegee across the screen.
    Objective 0.6:
    At this point the project should be able to dispense ink onto the screen.
    Objective 0.7:
    At this point the project should be able to clean itself.  It should turn off the valve for ink, turn on a valve for water and detergent and start the water pump.
    Objective 0.8:
    At this point the project should be able to communicate with future equipement, used in the silk screen process.
    Objective 0.9:
    At this point the project should be able to communicate with a server. The purpose of the server is to monitor the status of the machinery and collect data.
    Objective 1.0:
    At this point the circuitry for the project should be moved to a pcb design, and the machine should be able to produce the pcb.
